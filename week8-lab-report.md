# Week 8 Lab Report 4 

[The link to my markdown repository.]()
[The link to the reviewed markdown repository from week 7.]()


## Snippet 1
```
`[a link`](url.com)

[another link](`google.com)`

[`cod[e`](google.com)

[`code]`](ucsd.edu)
```
* The test
* What it should produce
* How I turned it into a test in **MarkdownParseTest.java**
* My implementation's corresponding output
* Week 7 implementation's corresponding output
* *Do you think there is a small (<10 lines) code change that will make your program work for snippet 1 and all related cases that use inline code with backticks? If yes, describe the code change. If not, describe why it would be a more involved change.* 

## Snippet 2
```
[a [nested link](a.com)](b.com)

[a nested parenthesized url](a.com(()))

[some escaped \[ brackets \]](example.com)
```

* The test
* What it should produce
* How I turned it into a test in **MarkdownParseTest.java**
* My implementation's corresponding output
* Week 7 implementation's corresponding output
* *Do you think there is a small (<10 lines) code change that will make your program work for snippet 2 and all related cases that nest parentheses, brackets, and escaped brackets? If yes, describe the code change. If not, describe why it would be a more involved change.* 

## Snippet 3

[this link doesn't have a closing parenthesis](github.com

And there's still some more text after that.

[this link doesn't have a closing parenthesis for a while](https://cse.ucsd.edu/



)

And then there's more text

* My implementation's corresponding output
* Week 7 implementation's corresponding output
* *Do you think there is a small (<10 lines) code change that will make your program work for snippet 3 and all related cases that have newlines in brackets and parentheses? If yes, describe the code change. If not, describe why it would be a more involved change.*
